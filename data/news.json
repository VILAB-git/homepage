      "description": "We are glad to introduce Professor <strong>Kuk-Jin Yoon</strong>'s remarkable achievement in winning the <strong>Test of Time Award at the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025)</strong>.<br><br>Professor Kuk-Jin Yoon’s research group in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST, in collaboration with Professor Ming-Hsuan Yang at UC Merced and Professor Jongwoo Lim at Seoul National University, has been honored with the Test of Time Award at the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025) for their 2015 paper, <i><strong>Bayesian Multi-object Tracking using Motion Context from Multiple Objects</strong></i>.<br><br>The Test of Time Award is a prestigious recognition given to outstanding research that continues to influence both academia and industry long after its publication. Highly regarded in the field of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), this paper remains extensively cited and widely applied even a decade later.<br><br>In this work, the authors introduced the concept of motion context into a Bayesian multi-object tracking framework, proposing a novel approach that overcomes the limitations of existing methods. By employing a Relative Motion Network (RMN) to model relative movements among objects, they successfully mitigated the effects of global camera motion and enhanced tracking accuracy. This pioneering method has significantly contributed to the advancement of multi-object tracking technology and has seen practical adoption in various domains, including autonomous driving, video surveillance, and sports analytics.<br><br>IEEE/CVF WACV is recognized as one of the leading conferences in the computer vision community, particularly esteemed for its focus on application-oriented research. This award stands as a testament to the enduring global impact and research excellence demonstrated by Professor Yoon's group.",

To address the problem of relying on approximation-based methods for estimating bidirectional motion fields in existing video frame interpolation approaches, this paper proposes an asymmetric bidirectional motion field estimation method that carefully considers the characteristics of the RGB camera used in event cameras.<br><br> Furthermore, we developed hardware based on a beam-splitter setup for high-resolution event cameras and RGB cameras. We demonstrated the superiority of this method by proposing the ERF-X170XPS dataset, a large-scale video frame interpolation dataset using event cameras. <br><br> This research is expected to be highly useful in environments requiring the analysis of ultra-high-speed motion, such as drones and autonomous vehicles.",
